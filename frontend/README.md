# Disk Scheduling Simulator — Frontend

Run the frontend development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:3000` by default. The UI includes:
- Example buttons for each algorithm (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, C-LOOK)
- A custom input panel where you can paste comma-separated requests, set start head and disk size, and choose direction
- A results table and a simple head-movement chart

By default example runs use a sample request list so you can see outputs without entering custom input.
