# Disk Scheduling Algorithm Simulator

A cross-platform simulator for various disk scheduling algorithms, featuring a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to provide an interactive platform to visualize and compare the performance of different disk scheduling algorithms used in operating systems.

## Intended Features
- **Simulation**: Visualize how different algorithms handle a sequence of disk requests.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of head movements over time.
- **Compare Mode**: Run multiple algorithms on the same dataset to compare their efficiency in terms of total head movement.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (intended)
- **Charts**: Recharts or Chart.js (intended)

## Project Structure
- `backend/`: FastAPI application stubs and logic.
- `frontend/`: React application components and services.
